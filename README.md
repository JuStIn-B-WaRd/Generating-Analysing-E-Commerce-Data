# E-Commerce Data Ingestion and Analysis
This project consists of two phases. Phase 1 deals with generating approximately 15,000 mock E-Commerce orders, along with approximately 5% of bad data, and saving it to a .csv file. Phase 2 deals with taking a separate E-Commerce dataset, processing the data with Spark, and discovering trends based on given market questions. Both phases are completed using Python, with the data processing done using PySpark. Git and GitHub are used for version control management.
